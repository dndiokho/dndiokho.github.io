## Professional Self-Assessment

My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has strengthened both my technical foundation and my professional identity as a developing software engineer. Throughout the program, I progressed from learning fundamental programming principles to designing, enhancing, and evaluating complete software systems. The capstone experience allowed me to revisit earlier projects, critically assess my growth, and intentionally improve them using industry standards. This ePortfolio represents not only my technical abilities but also my development in problem-solving, structured thinking, and professional communication.

Throughout my coursework, I built competency in software design and engineering by developing applications that required clean architecture, modular design, and maintainability. In enhancing my Weight Tracker Android application, I improved separation of concerns, refined application structure, and ensured that database interactions were clearly organized within a helper class. These improvements demonstrate my understanding of scalable design principles and my ability to revisit and strengthen previous work.

My understanding of data structures and algorithms developed as I evaluated efficiency, logic flow, and trade-offs in design decisions. Rather than focusing solely on whether code functioned correctly, I learned to assess performance considerations and structural clarity. By refining data retrieval methods and implementing user-specific queries, I demonstrated the ability to apply algorithmic principles while maintaining readability and maintainability.

Database development became a significant area of growth during my program. Through working with SQLite and structured data storage, I gained experience implementing CRUD operations, managing user-specific records, and ensuring proper data validation. Enhancing my database logic required careful analysis of schema design, query efficiency, and data integrity. This strengthened my understanding of how backend data management directly influences application reliability.

Security awareness has also shaped my development as a computer scientist. Through coursework and artifact enhancement, I learned to approach development with a defensive mindset. I implemented input validation, considered potential vulnerabilities such as improper data access, and ensured that user information was handled responsibly. I now understand that security must be embedded in software design from the beginning rather than treated as an afterthought.

Although much of my capstone work was completed independently, I strengthened my collaboration skills through structured feedback and reflection. Incorporating instructor feedback required me to think from the perspective of stakeholders and adapt my work accordingly. In previous coursework, I also participated in collaborative environments that required communicating technical ideas clearly and professionally. These experiences enhanced my ability to translate technical decisions into language accessible to diverse audiences — a skill that is essential when working with clients, project managers, or interdisciplinary teams.

The artifacts included in this portfolio collectively demonstrate my progression across key domains in computer science. The Software Design and Engineering enhancement highlights my ability to structure and refine application architecture. The Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement illustrates analytical thinking and decision-making in logic implementation. The Database enhancement demonstrates practical experience with persistent storage and data integrity. Together, these artifacts represent a cohesive demonstration of my readiness to enter the field with a strong technical foundation and a growth-oriented mindset.

Overall, this program has shaped me into a more confident and capable computing professional. I now approach development with a focus on clarity, scalability, security, and user experience. The combination of technical knowledge, reflective improvement, and applied enhancement work within this portfolio demonstrates my readiness to contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science.
